Logic, Mereology, classical and topological Geometries

Le≈õniewski's logical system is based on three formal components: Protothetic (a theory of relationships between propositions), Ontology (a logic of names), and Mereology (a general theory of part and whole). 
In these works, we deal with mereological reasoning and propose an interpretation of the above-mentioned
system in terms of set theory, focusing, in particular, on the formalisation of the relation "part of". As a result, the package provides a translation of
Mereology.
